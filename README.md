# Configuring OpenSSH on macOS

OpenSSH configuration files are located in `/etc/ssh/` and `~/.ssh/`.

## SSH Server Configuration

1. **Locate the configuration file**:

   The primary SSH server configuration file is `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. You can edit this file using a text editor like `nano` or `vim`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
